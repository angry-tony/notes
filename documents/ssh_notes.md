## Passwordless SSH Login


Sometimes administrative tasks require to connect to a machine via ssh without being asked for a password, this can be accomplished by doing tthe follwoing.

On the machine that you want to ssh from create the key

```
root@host1# ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa
```

The `id_pub.rsa` file will be in the `~/.ssh` directory. Now `scp` the `id_pub.rsa` key to the machine you want to ssh to

```
root@host1# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub host2
```
Now you should be able to ssh into host2 from host1 and it wont prompt you for a password. If you are having troubles make sure that `authorized_keys` is set to `664` permissions and your `id_rsa` private key is `600`.

## SSH Tunnels

You can establish "tunnels" via SSH.

Bind your local port 8080 to remote server's 80

```
root@host# ssh host2 -L 8080:host2:80
```

Then on a web browser you can go to...

```
http://localhost:8080
```

And see the site.

This is not restricted to the remote host. For example If you can "see" a Linux host in a network but you can't see a Windows machine that you want to RDP into (that's in the same network); you can establish a tunnel.

```
root@host# ssh host2 -L 3389:windowshost:3389
```

Then on your RDP Client type in

```
localhost:3389
```

You can use ssh tunnels to "bounce" around a network.

### Gateways

You can use SSH as a gateway. I did the following at 4over to set up a consisten SSH tunnel gateway that runs in the background

```
root@host# ssh -i /usr/local/lib/cci.key -CfNg 216.133.247.10 -l over4 -L 1433:192.180.1.7:1433
```

Basically I created an SSH key first then used port fowarding with special options.

* `-i /usr/local/lib/cci.key` The identity file to use
* `-C` Use Compression
* `-f` Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution
* `-N` Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports
* `-g` Allows other machines to connect to this machine (gateway mode)
* `-l over4` login account to use
* `-L 1433:192.180.1.7:1433` Use local port 1433 and bind it to 192.180.1.7:1433

For a "reverse tunnel" (i.e. tunnel back into the server I'm ssh-ing from)

```
root@host# ssh -CfN cci-bridge.4over.com -l root -R 2222:localhost:22
```

## SSH Webproxy

A SOCKS proxy is basically an SSH tunnel in which specific applications forward their traffic down the tunnel to the server, and then on the server end, the proxy forwards the traffic out to the general Internet. Unlike a VPN, a SOCKS proxy has to be configured on an app by app basis on the client machine, but can be set up without any specialty client agents.

Example:

```
ssh -D 8123 -f -C -q -N user@sample.server.com
```

The breakdown

* `-D 8123` Use SOCKS under specified port number (you can choose a number between 1025-65536)
* `-f` Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution
* `-C` Use Compression
* `-q` Uses quiet mode
*  `-N` Do not execute a remote command. 

Then under Firefox (for example) Set the following settings (specifying your port...in the picture it's 1337 but use what you specified...like above it's 8123)

## User Security

You can allow who can ssh into the system within the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.

```
root@host# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  AllowUsers mike chrish
```

You can also restrict from where they ssh from

```
root@host# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  AllowUsers mike@192.168.2.122 chrish@192.168.2.54
```

Other options include (which are pretty self explanitory)

```
AllowGroups
DenyUsers
DenyGroups
```

SSH logs to: `/var/log/secure`

## X11 Forwarding

First install on the server you want Forwading on

```
root@host# yum -y install xorg-x11-xauth xorg-x11-utils xorg-x11-fonts-*
```


The next step is to check the configuration of the SSH service running on the server. By default, the SSH
server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has variable X11 forwarding enabled
in file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` through variable `X11Forwarding yes`. Ensure that this has not been
changed. If it has changed, set the variable to yes and restart the sshd.

```
root@host# service sshd restart
```

Now you can ssh into the server and run X11 Apps

```
root@host# ssh -X host2
```

## Shell In A Box

To install `shellinabox` you need to have EPEL configured.

For example, running EL7 (versions may differ)

```
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-8.noarch.rpm
```

Install the pkgs

```
yum -y install openssl shellinabox
```

Next configure it.

```
root@host# cat /etc/sysconfig/shellinaboxd

# TCP port that shellinboxd's webserver listens on
###PORT=6175
PORT=443
# specify the IP address of a destination SSH server
OPTS="--disable-ssl-menu  --service /:SSH"
###OPTS="-s /:SSH:172.16.25.125"

# if you want to restrict access to shellinaboxd from localhost only
#OPTS="-s /:SSH:172.16.25.125 --localhost-only"
```

Start/enable

```
systemctl enable shellinaboxd.service
systemctl start shellinaboxd.service
```

**IF** you have firewall enabled

```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
```

## SSH Sessions

Keep SSH session on if you keep getting kicked out

```
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=15 -o ServerAliveCountMax=4 $HOST
```

Explanation:
  * `ServerAliveInterval` ~ Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.
  * `ServerAliveCountMax` ~ Sets the number of server alive messages which may be sent without ssh receiving any messages back from the server.  If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session

## SSH Agent

Using SSH Shell (`ssh-agent`); these are quicknotes

```
$ exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent $SHELL

$ ssh-add -l
The agent has no identities.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/github
Identity added: /home/chernand/.ssh/github (/home/chernand/.ssh/github)

$ ssh-add -l

```

## Misc Notes

These are Misc notes

* [Home Dir](#home-dir)

### Home Dir

Places in your homedir is defined by nautilus in `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs`

```
[chernand@chernand ~]$ cat  ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
# This file is written by xdg-user-dirs-update
# If you want to change or add directories, just edit the line you're
# interested in. All local changes will be retained on the next run
# Format is XDG_xxx_DIR="$HOME/yyy", where yyy is a shell-escaped
# homedir-relative path, or XDG_xxx_DIR="/yyy", where /yyy is an
# absolute path. No other format is supported.
#
XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Desktop"
XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/Downloads"
XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/Templates"
XDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR="$HOME/Public"
XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR="$HOME/Documents"
XDG_MUSIC_DIR="$HOME/Music"
XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Pictures"
XDG_VIDEOS_DIR="$HOME/Videos"
```
