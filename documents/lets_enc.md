# Let's Encrypt

This  will show you how to set up a TLS/SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](http://letsencrypt.org/) to use for webservers/websreveces. Additionally, we will cover how to automate the certificate renewal process using a cron job.

SSL certificates are used within web servers to encrypt the traffic between server and client, providing extra security for users accessing your application. Letâ€™s Encrypt provides an easy way to obtain and install trusted certificates for free.

For this purposes we will be using `feodra` and the certification automation tool called `certbot`

Also `acme.sh` is available.

* [Request Certificate](#request-certificate)
* [Renewal](#renewal)

## Installation

First, make sure the system is updated

```
dnf -y clean all
dnf -y update
```

Next, install `certbot`

```
dnf -y install certbot
```

For EL7 users, you might need to do this

```
subscription-manager repos --disable=*
subscription-manager repos --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
--enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```

The help menu should be enough to get you started

```
$ certbot --help

  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
cert. The most common SUBCOMMANDS and flags are:

obtain, install, and renew certificates:
    (default) run   Obtain & install a cert in your current webserver
    certonly        Obtain or renew a cert, but do not install it
    renew           Renew all previously obtained certs that are near expiry
   -d DOMAINS       Comma-separated list of domains to obtain a cert for

  (the certbot apache plugin is not installed)
  --standalone      Run a standalone webserver for authentication
  (the certbot nginx plugin is not installed)
  --webroot         Place files in a server's webroot folder for authentication
  --manual          Obtain certs interactively, or using shell script hooks

   -n               Run non-interactively
  --test-cert       Obtain a test cert from a staging server
  --dry-run         Test "renew" or "certonly" without saving any certs to disk

manage certificates:
    certificates    Display information about certs you have from Certbot
    revoke          Revoke a certificate (supply --cert-path)
    delete          Delete a certificate

manage your account with Let's Encrypt:
    register        Create a Let's Encrypt ACME account
  --agree-tos       Agree to the ACME server's Subscriber Agreement
   -m EMAIL         Email address for important account notifications

More detailed help:

  -h, --help [TOPIC]    print this message, or detailed help on a topic;
                        the available TOPICS are:

   all, automation, commands, paths, security, testing, or any of the
   subcommands or plugins (certonly, renew, install, register, nginx,
   apache, standalone, webroot, etc.)
```

## Request Certificate

First; you need to allow `80` and `443` in your firewall config

```
firewall-cmd --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --add-service=https
firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
```

Simply pass `-d domain.tld` to request for a certificate (for multiple domains pass multiple `-d`)

```
certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com --agree-tos -m example@example.com
```

Note that `example.com` must be resolve-able

Your certificates (along with a README) will be placed under:

```
/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your domain>
```

## Renewal

Let's Encrypt certs are temporary; you can cron the recreation with...

```
15 1 * * 7 /usr/bin/certbot renew --renew-hook "systemctl restart httpd" >> /var/log/le-renew.log
```

Certs expire every 90 days or so...so I set it to run every other week. It's probably better to create a wrapper script for this (in case you need to do a "song and dance" like for OpenShift)
